1. I highly encourage using terminal to do all github stuff!

2. Install Git if you don't have it 
sudo apt-get install git

3. make a new directory (such as Git)
mkdir Git

3. go into the directory and clone this repo

cd Git
git clone https://github.com/USMA-SIGSAC/learn-C

4. make a new directory using your handle/githubID/name(if you choose to do so)
in learn-C directy

cd /learn-C
mkdir higunwoo //example

5. inside your directory, put your learn C progress!

6. after you are done for the day, update and save your commit by

git add --all
git comimt -m "ex1, ex2, ex3" 
(you can put whatever message describing your commit between " ")

7. submit your commit by
git push origin

(If you have any questions, ask batman or higunwoo.)
