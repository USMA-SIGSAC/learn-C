How to create your Own Branch and Submit it from your computer to GitHub using command line

0. First  Create your branch by using your LastName! ( Look here: http://imgur.com/ONh9kDk )

1. Use Terminal(linux preferrably or use powershell on windows)

2. install git
sudo apt-get install git :for linux

3. make a new directory and clone this repository(submission folder)
git clone -b LastName https://github.com/USMA-SIGSAC/learn-C
: this will make a copy of submission folder in your computer!

It will ask for credentials. Enter your Github ID and password!
You should have a learn-C folder in your computer after this.
This will be your local folder to work on learn C!!

Let's test it out by creating a test file(making changes) and uploading it!

** FROM NOW ON YOU MUST BE INSIDE "/learn-C" Directory when you use any of the commands.

4. make changes.
For example 
nano Testing.txt
type "LastName testing" into the file. 
ctrl x
y
Enter

This is your test file! 
Now, it is time to upload your changes to your own branch!

5. Check Status before saving.
Always type 

git status  :to check your status of the changes!
git add --all  :to reflect all the changes!!

6. make commit
Commits are new versions of the file. 
This is like saving a new file before uploading.

Make a commit by using
git commit -m "This is uploading test file!" : this command will save the changes as a commit!
You can replace "This is uploading test file!" with any message that can help you track this commit.

7. push commit
Finally we are uploading(pushing) to github server!

git push origin LastName : to upload your commits to MyBranchName branch!
It might ask for credentials again.

8. Check Website to make sure if your file is uploaded!
