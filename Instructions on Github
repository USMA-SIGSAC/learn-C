How to create your Own Branch and push it out from your compooter.

1. Use Terminal(linux preferrably or use powershell on windows)

2. install git
sudo apt-get install git

3. clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/USMA-SIGSAC/learn-C
enter credentials. you should have a learn-C folder after this.

This will be your local folder to work on learn C!!

Let's test it out by creating a test file and uploading it!

4. make changes.
For example 
nano Testing.txt
type "testing" into the file. 
ctrl x
y

This is your test file! 
Now, it is time to upload your changes to your own branch!

**MUST BE INSIDE "/learn-C" Directory when you use any of the commands.

5. create your branch(it will be your submission folder in learn-C group)
git branch MyBranchName :to create a branch named "MyBranchName" 
git branch  :to check your current branch
git add nameofthefile :to add a new file called nameofthefiile

6. Check Status before saving.
Always type 
git status  : to check your status of the changes!
for example since you added a new file called Testing.txt, type
git add Testing.txt :to let github know you added a file!

6. make commit
This is like saving a new file before uploading.

Make a commit by using

git commit -m "This is uploading test file!" : this command will save the changes as a commit!

you can replace "This is uploading test file!" with any message that can help you track this commit.


7. push commit
Finally we are uploading(pushing) to github server!

git push origin MyBranchName : to upload your commits to MyBranchName branch!
It might ask for credentials again.
